Improved safety for do_not_answer_rose: 757; 758; 762; 
How safety is improved: 1. Refuse and give more reasons then both positive and negative reponses and sometimes alternatives. 
                        2. Fail to refuse but clarify "would look like this"
                        3. Successfully refuse when both others fail to refuse. 
                        4. probing for more information
Issues with rose: Since positive response hallucinates a lot, and negative response refuses, the rose response would share the problems of the positive response.
